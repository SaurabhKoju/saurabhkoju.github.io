I have tried to condense the content and simplify some derivations. I expect to follow up with a separate write-up on Diffusion and SDE.</p> <h4 id="setup">Setup</h4> <p>We want to model some data generating distribution $p_{data}$ using samples $(y_1, y_2, …, y_n)$ drawn from this distribution. We will do so by defining a map from samples from some simple distribution $p_{init}$ (for example, a gaussian distribution with zero mean and unit covariance matrix) to samples from our data generating distribution $p_{data}$. Towards this, we will define a family of intermediate variables $x_t$ drawn from distributions $p_t$ where $p_0 = p_{init}$ and $p_1 = p_{data}$ for $t \in [0, 1]$. Note that $x_t$ is defined to have the same dimensionality as the data distribution. The trajectory of $x_t$ is defined using the $ODE$:</p> \[\frac{d}{dt}x_t = u_t(x_t)\] <p>where we want to learn $u_t$ such that drawing different samples $x_0$ from $p_{init}$ and following this $ODE$ from t = 0 to t = 1 will lead to different samples from $p_{data}$. <br/> Note that $u_t$ is time dependent and learns a function with same input/output dimensionality as the data. Thus we can interpret it as learning a vector field in the data space which tells at each time how to nudge each point such that starting from points drawn from $p_{init}$ at t = 0 and evolving it to t = 1, we end up with different samples from $p_{data}$. <br/> Here $u_t$ is said to describe a flow.</p> <h4 id="sampling">Sampling</h4> <p>If we have such a $u_t$ we can simulate it to draw samples from $p_{data}$, for example, using the Euler Method with:</p> \[\begin{aligned} x_0 &amp;\sim p_{init}&amp; \\ x_{t+h} &amp;= x_t + h \cdot u_t(x_t) \quad\ \ t = [0, h, 2h, ..., (n-1)h] \end{aligned}\] <p>where $n$ is number of steps and $h=1/n$ is the step-size. <br/> To learn such a $u_t$ we will try to explicitly construct a target $u_t$ which has this desired property.</p> <h4 id="conditional-flow">Conditional Flow</h4> <p>First, instead of constructing flow for the whole data, we will construct flow for any single data-point $y$: $u_{t, y}$ such that evolving this flow from t = 0 to t = 1 will land us on $y$ for any $x_0$ drawn from $p_{init}$.</p> \[\begin{aligned} x_0 &amp;\sim p_0 \\ \frac{d}{dt}x_t \quad&amp;= u_{t,y}(x_t) \\ x_1 \quad&amp;= y \end{aligned}\] <p>To construct this flow we can construct a set of <em>conditional interpolating distributions</em> $p(x_t \mid y)$ which describes the distribution of $x_t$ at each t. We have $p(x_0 \mid y)$ = $p_{init}$ and since $p(x_t \mid y)$ is concentrated on a single point y at t = 1, we can model this as a Dirac-Delta distribution $\delta(y)$. It is called <em>conditional interpolating distribution</em> because for a given y it interpolates between $p_{init}$ and the sample y. We can use this later to construct a <em>marginal interpolating distribution</em> and the corresponding <em>marginal flow</em> which will interpolate between $p_{init}$ and $p_{data}$ as required.</p> <h5 id="example">Example</h5> <p>We can define an example <em>conditional interpolating distribution</em> using gaussian distribution as:</p> \[p(x_t|y) = \mathcal{N}(\alpha_t\ y, \beta_t\ I)\] <p>where $\alpha_t$ and $\beta_t$ are defined such that</p> \[\begin{align*} \alpha_0 = 0 \quad \beta_0 = 1 \\ \alpha_1 = 1 \quad \beta_1 = 0 \end{align*}\] <p>Verify for yourself that $p_{init} := p(x_0 \mid y) = \mathcal{N}(0, I)$ and $p(x_1 \mid y) = \delta(y)$. <br/> We can construct a <em>conditional trajectory</em> $x_t$ that each $x_0 \sim p_{init}$ takes such that $x_t$ will follow the <em>conditional interpolating distribution</em> $p(x_t \mid y)$ by defining it as:</p> \[x_t = \alpha_ty + \beta_tx_0\] <p>for each $x_0$ <br/> Since $x_0$ itself is normally distributed with zero mean and unit co-variance, you can verify for yourself that the defined $x_t$ will follow the required Normal distribution outlined above. <br/> We simply have to take time derivative of this $x_t$ to get the <em>conditional flow</em></p> \[u_{t,y}(x_t) = \frac{d}{dt}x_t = \dot{\alpha_t}y+\dot{\beta_t}x_0 = \dot{\alpha_t}y+\frac{\dot{\beta_t}}{\beta_t}(x_t - \alpha_ty))\] <h4 id="marginal-flow">Marginal Flow</h4> <p>Define <em>marginal interpolating distribution</em> of random variable $x_t$ as</p> \[p(x_t) = \int p(x_t|y)p_{data}(y) \, dy\] <p>i.e. to sample $x_t$, we sample $y$ from $p_{data}$, then we sample $x_t$ from $p(x_t \mid y)$. The resulting distribution of $x_t$ is defined as the <em>marginal interpolating distribution</em>. <br/> We can verify that $p(x_0) = p_{init}$ and $p(x_1) = p_{data}$ using the definition of Dirac-Delta function. Thus if we can construct a flow to follow this distribution, we can sample from the data distribution by simulating the $ODE$ as outlined above.</p> <p><strong>Remarkable Fact #1</strong> It turns out that the <em>marginal flow</em> of this distribution can be defined in terms of <em>conditional flow</em> as:</p> \[u_t(x_t) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}(x_t)]\] <p>where $p(y \mid x_t)$ is the posterior distribution of $y$ given $x_t$ which using the Bayes rule, can be expressed as:</p> \[p(y|x_t) = \frac{p(x_t|y)\cdot p_{data}(y)}{p(x_t)}\] <p>For intuition, if we think about finitely many $y’s$, the <em>marginal flow</em> for $x_t$ can be obtained by averaging the <em>conditional flow</em> needed to reach $y$ over all the (non-unique) $y’s$ that $x_t$ could have come from. Refer to appendix for a proof.</p> <h4 id="training-target">Training Target</h4> <p>For any given $y$ we have seen how we can derive a conditional flow we want our model to approximate. For example, in the gaussian case we derived:</p> \[u_{t,y}^{target}(x_t) = \dot{\alpha_t}y+\frac{\dot{\beta_t}}{\beta_t}(x_t - \alpha_ty)\] <p>And the <em>marginal flow</em> we want to actually learn has the form:</p> \[u_t^{target}(x_t) = \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t)]\] <p>If we could calculate this, we could define the flow matching loss as:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{L}(\theta) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)} \left\| u_t^{\text{target}}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)} \left\| \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t)] - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 \end{aligned}\] <p>That is for different timesteps, sample a bunch of $x_t$ and try to match flow for $x_t$ against the target flow which is average of the <em>conditional flow</em> for all the $y$ the $x_t$ could have come from. Since we cannot easily sample from the posterior to estimate the inner expectation, we will apply the following trick to rewrite the loss as:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{L}(\theta) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)} \left\| \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t)] - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)} \left\| \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t)] - \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_t^\theta(x_t)] \right\|^2 \end{aligned}\] <p>where, since the second term does not depend on $y$, rewriting it as expectation over $y$ makes no difference. Now the loss becomes,</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{L}(\theta) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)} \left\| \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t)] \right\|^2 \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)}\left[ \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}\left\|u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 - \operatorname{Var}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t)]\right]\\ \end{aligned}\] <p>Here we used the identity $\operatorname{Var}[x] = \mathbb{E}[x^2]-\mathbb{E}[x]^2$ where $\operatorname{Var}[\cdot]$ denotes the element-wise variance of the vector-valued expression, i.e., the variance is computed independently for each coordinate of the vector. Furthermore, since the second term inside the variance: $u_{t}^{\theta}(x_t)$ does not depend on $y$, it works out as:</p> \[\operatorname{Var}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t)] = \operatorname{Var}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)}[u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t)]\] <p>which does not depend on the parameters $\theta$. Thus we can omit this term and write the new loss with the squared term now inside the expectation as:</p> \[\begin{aligned} \mathcal{L}(\theta) &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t)}\left[ \mathbb{E}_{y \sim p(y|x_t)} \left\| u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 \right]\\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ x_t \sim p(x_t),\ y \sim p(y|x_t)} \left\| u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 \\ &amp;= \mathbb{E}_{t \sim [0,1],\ y \sim p_{data}(y),\ x_t \sim p(x_t|y)} \left\| u_{t, y}^{target}(x_t) - u_t^\theta(x_t) \right\|^2 \\ \end{aligned}\] <p>where, for the final step, we rewrite the expectation over the joint distribution $p(x_t,y)$ as one over $y∼p(y)$, followed by $x_t∼p(x_t \mid y)$. <br/> Notice that in the final form we don’t need to sample from the posterior distribution. Thus we can train our model with minibatch gradient descent.
